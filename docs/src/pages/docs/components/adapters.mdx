# GraphQL Debugger Adapters

GraphQL Debugger's storage layer is pluggable, GraphQL Debugger contains a few adapters out of the box, but you can also write your own.

Adapters should be used alongside [The Client](/docs/packages/client).

## Base Adapter

The Base Adapter is the interface that all adapters must implement. It contains entities such as: Spans, Traces and Schemas and exposes extendable methods to interact with them. To learn more about The Base Adapter check out the `@graphql-debugger/adapter-base` lib.

## Proxy Adapter

The Proxy Adapter will forward all read and writes over the [GraphQL Schema](/docs/packages/graphql-schema) and to the [Collector](/docs/components/collector), this is what most will use pointing to a local or remote instance.

### Getting Started

#### Install

```bash
npm install @graphql-debugger/adapter-proxy
```

#### Usage

```ts
import { ProxyAdapter } from '@graphql-debugger/adapter-proxy'

const adapter = new ProxyAdapter({
  apiURL: 'http://localhost:16686',
  collectorURL: 'http://localhost:4318'
});

// or if you want to use the default values
const adapter = new ProxyAdapter();
```

## SQLite Adapter

This is used locally when you use the [CLI](/docs/packagaes/cli), It is a simple SQLite database that stores all the data locally. This is not recommended for production use.

### Getting Started

#### Install

```bash
npm install @graphql-debugger/adapter-sqlite
```

#### Usage

```ts
import { SQLiteAdapter } from "@graphql-debugger/adapter-sqlite";

const adapter = new SQLiteAdapter();
```

> Note that SQLite Adapter will use [Prisma](https://prisma.io) thru to SQLite. The database will be created in the `node_modules/@graphql-debugger/data-access/prisma/dev.db`.
