# @graphql-debugger/graphql-yoga

GraphQL Debugger support for [GraphQL Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga).

## Installation

```bash
npm install @graphql-debugger/graphql-yoga
```

## Usage

The Plugin is a wrapper around [GraphQL Yoga](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-yoga), replace the import with this lib.

```diff
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
- import { createYoga } from "graphql-yoga";
+ import { createYoga } from "@graphql-debugger/graphql-yoga";

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
});
```

## Options

The options are passed thru to Yoga, so you can use all the options from there. In addition you can pass the `debugger` entry to configure GraphQL Debugger.

```ts
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { createYoga } from "@graphql-debugger/graphql-yoga";

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

const yoga = createYoga({
  schema,
  debugger: {
    adapter?: Adapter,
    shouldDisable?: boolean,
    ... other options see types
  },
});
```

import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

<Callout emoji="⚠️">
  If you do not pass thru an adapter, the default Proxy Adapter will be used,
  see the [Adapters Section](/docs/components/adapters) for more information.
